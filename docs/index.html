            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! My name is Sylbi and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science with minors in
                Business
                Administration and English at NC State University
                located in Raleigh, NC. Born in Queens, NY and raised in Charlotte, NC I enjoy fitness/health, singing,
                playing piano, and reading
                different genres! I created this website so
                I could have a creative outlet to write about my passions, document my life, and showcase my
                accomplishments thus far. Feel free to peruse and play around with some fun projects!
            </p><br>

            <h4>Why Computer Science?</h4>
            <p>
                Fun fact: In Korean culture, on a child's first birthday they will be confronted by a plethora of random
                objects.
                Naturally, the child will pick out a few objects from the table. This monumental memory provides magic 8
                ball insight
                into the child's future. I picked up a microphone (love of music/vocal talent), a book and pencil
                (reading/writing/academics),
                yarn (strength/health), a paintbrush (creativity), cash (abundance), and... a computer mouse?<br><br>

                Everything else manifested itself into my life, but I was still confused about the computer mouse. Video
                games made me
                clumsy whereas books became my obstacle-free world. College exposed me to computer science and the
                endless possibilities
                of innovative problem-solving and technology. I was originally a Business Administration major but
                decided to make the switch
                because it allowed me to explore my analytical and technical skills.
                After my first coding class, I was so intrigued that I
                continued to learn other
                languages and work on fun projects in my free time.
            </p><br>

            <h4>The Interplay Between Business, English, and Computer Science</h4>
            <p>
                Put simply, without business there would be no technology. Without technology there would be no computer science students.
                What fuels my passion for projects isn't just the code—it's the people who will ultimately use it.
                I develop with a focus on maximizing value for the end user.
                My English studies, along with my love for literature, have taught me empathy and the ability to see the
                world through diverse perspectives.
                Understanding different characters—real or fictional—reminds me of our shared humanity, a connection
                that transcends our differences.
                Creative writing, a passion I hope to continuously nurture, combats ignorance, stimulates creative thinking, and
                uncovers beauty in the unconventional.
                Each new story I engage with reshapes my perspective, making me feel more connected to the human
                experience.

                In the rigorous world of computer science, it's easy to become absorbed in technical details and forget
                the user behind the screen.
                But ultimately, it’s the user who gives meaning to the technology we create, not vice versa.
